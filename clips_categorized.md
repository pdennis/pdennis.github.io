| 1 | Feb 2025 | The Nation | "The Battle to Protect Healthcare Will Define the Second Trump Era" | [Link](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trump-cuts-health-care/) |
| 2 | Jun 5, 2025 | Washington Post | "Trolling Trump with 'TACO' Meme Is Bad Strategy for Democrats" | [Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/05/taco-trump-always-chickens-out-tariffs-democrats/) |
| 3 | Jul 16, 2025 | Washington Post | "Democrats Are Right to Call for the Release of the Epstein Files" | [Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/16/democrats-epstein-files-trump/) |
| 4 | Aug 27, 2025 | Philadelphia Inquirer | "Underneath Stacy Garrity's Veneer of Apolitical Moderation Is a Far-Right Operative" | [Link](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/gop-stacy-garrity-josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-governor-trump-20250827.html) |
| 5 | Sep 2, 2025 | New York Times | Trump / Imperial Presidency (exact title unconfirmed -- behind paywall) | [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/opinion/trump-winning-imperial-presidency.html) |

**Notes:**
- **The Nation** piece addresses Trump's attempted Medicaid cuts affecting 22 million Americans and the broader healthcare threat.
- **WaPo "TACO"** piece argues that Democrats' viral "Trump Always Chickens Out" meme on tariffs, while fun, is a losing strategy and the party should focus elsewhere.
- **WaPo "Epstein"** piece makes the case that Democrats are right to press for full release of the Epstein files and that Trump's cover-up betrays his own base; cites polling showing 59% of Trump voters believe the government is hiding Epstein evidence.
- **Inquirer** piece exposes PA State Treasurer Stacy Garrity's far-right record beneath her moderate persona ahead of the governor's race, and contrasts it with Gov. Shapiro's bipartisan record.
- **NYT** piece is in the opinion section and is almost certainly a guest essay (paywall prevented full confirmation).
