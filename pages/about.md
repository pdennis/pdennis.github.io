## Who am I?

I'm Pat Dennis, President of [American Bridge 21st Century](https://americanbridgepac.org/). I've spent over 15 years in political opposition research, working on every level of race — local, state, congressional, gubernatorial, senate, and presidential.

Before American Bridge, I served as Research Director for the Ohio Democratic Party and held senior research positions on competitive campaigns at every level of government.

At American Bridge, my team has consistently uncovered and pitched career-ending stories on Republicans running up and down the ballot. Our research has appeared in millions of dollars worth of ads and generated tens of millions in earned media value.

I care about winning elections, particularly through earned media. Earned media is the political water we swim in, and matters more than almost anybody gives it credit for.

I'm also focused on modernizing opposition research through technology — building tools to change how campaigns and organizations do research and track video.

I care about building effective organizations that people want to work for. Not because they're easy to work for, but because they're an engine for accomplishing, together, goals that are meaningful and too big for any one person to achieve alone.
