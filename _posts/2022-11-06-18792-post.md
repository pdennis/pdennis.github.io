# How does this blog work?

Good question. I'm typing it out now, because at the moment, I remember how it works. But that won't last much longer.

## Telegram bot

First, I built a bot with the botfather, and plugged that  into a service called Pipedream, which is a sort of like ifttt for developers. 

## Pipedream

Pipedream takes in the json from the telegram bot, uses jq to strip out just the text of the message and pass it to a variable. It clones the repo for this github pages site, and then formats the text of the message into a post. It then commits its changes back into the repo

## Github pages
The blog itself is based on a template called Chirpy, which conveniently comes with a GitHub action that builds and deploys itself whenever you commit. This is a big timesaver, and the reason I didn't have to code an extra step to deploy. It's pretty nice.
