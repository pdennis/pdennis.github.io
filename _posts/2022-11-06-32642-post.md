# Why Did I Build This Site?

With all the Elon Musk inspired Twitter chaos, I've been thinking about a few things: What would I do if Twitter went away? What do I get from Twitter that I would really lose? 

One of the first things that jumped out at me was this: Twitter inspires me to write. Why? My best guess is that it gives me a few things: constant stimulus to get my brain moving, instant feedback, low friction, low stakes. 

At least some parts of that, though, I think could be replicated without Twitter itself. 

So that's what tis blog is. It's low friction, it's low stakes, it provides me with prompts (in the form of a random question at a random time every day). The instant feedback part isn't there yet, and I think that's important, but perhaps by auto-posting to social networks, I'll get there.
