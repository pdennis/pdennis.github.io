Title: I'm just making this post to verify myself on Mastodon

So, here's the thing. This website is created via Jekyll. It involves Ruby. It's configured with Yaml. It's a template somebody else made. I could add this little bit of code to the site, somehow, sure. But I would have to fire up git, poke around, read documentation, and figure it all out. So, instead, I'm going to add an HTML tag below in this post. 

Hell, it might not even work. Wouldn't that be embarassing? 

But here's another thing: even if it doesn't successfully verify me on Mastodon, this will crosspost to Twitter, where posting links to mastodon is banned. But here's one anyway: indieweb.social/@patdennis. Tricked you, Twitter! 

Alright, I'm pasting in the tag. We'll see.
