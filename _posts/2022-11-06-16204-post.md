# Tricking myself 

Like many people who want to write, I often find myself confronting an odd state of affairs: I find myself staring at a blank page, unable to produce something coherent. 20 minutes later, a friend could text me a question, or I see a twitter post, and I'm 1000 words into responding before I even realize it's happening. 

I want to help myself help myself, so that's what this tool is about. 

## The vision

Ideally, I'd like this Telegram bot to take the place of a friend asking me a question that gets me riled up. I'll make a list of such prompts in advance, and have the Bot hit me with them at an irregular interval. My responses, in turn, will be automatically turned into blog posts.
